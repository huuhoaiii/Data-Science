# The problem

> **What did SpaceX manage to recycle boosters, a feat that was considered almost impossible many years ago?**
In the project, I will use data science methodologies to analyze the features that affect successful landings and predict outcomes based on these features.
> 

- **How can we choose the launch site that maximizes the chances of success?**
- **What features affect the success of a launch?**
- **How does the orbit impact the success of a launch?**
- **How does payload mass influence the success of a launch?**
- **Why is choosing the right launch site important?**
# About the project

### **Data Preparation**

- Collect data on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches using an API.
- Clean data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data.

### **Machine Learning Model Predictions**

- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
